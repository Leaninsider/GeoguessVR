# GeoguessVR

A project by Niels Nauwynck and Steven Vanden Broucke for the course Next generation user interfaces at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel.

Requirements:
- Install Unity 2017.
- Install Oculus Integration through the asset store.

Guide:
- All of our self written code assets can be found in the root folder /Assets with GeoguessVRGame.cs as the core of the project.
- Our scene environment can be found in /OVR/Scenes/GeoguessVR.unity
- Double clicking this scene will cause it to load.
- Pressing play on unity will cause our scene to run and the game to start.
- Take note that without an oculus, you will need a graphics card that allows it to render to stereo vision, which can be found in the unity inspector settings.
